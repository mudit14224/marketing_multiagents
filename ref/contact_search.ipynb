      " This article sheds more light on the #healthcare access challenge we’re facing in the U.S. Expanding access to care is one of our highest priorities at Sutter Health so we can help more patients lead better, healthier lives and make it quicker for them to receive care. This includes adding clinical capacity by growing our workforce – including the number of #physicians affiliated with our system. We’re not only recruiting today’s physicians, we’re investing in tomorrow’s through a significant commitment to and expansion of our Graduate Medical Education programs, which will ultimately train 1,000 residents and fellows a year. We’re also expanding our presence in the communities we serve by building new care centers, enhancing our existing facilities to ensure they best meet the needs of those we serve, and using #digital tools to make our care more accessible. It’s a big challenge and there’s much more to be done, but we’re making real progress thanks to great work by teams across our organization and our focus on making it easier for patients to navigate their care and engage with us when, where and how they want!\n",

      " I tried (and failed) at being concise…\n",
      "Today I am reflecting on the last 8 years since Scottsdale Providence Recovery Center opened its doors on 06/15/2016. Our journey began with a very small building and smaller team: 1 Therapist, 1 Counselor, 1 Case Manager, 1 Operations/BHT, & 1 PRN NP. \n",
      "We knew what we wanted to do and we knew what our goals were. Things started very slowly and took about 2-3 months to hit our 10th admit, our very small startup capital was slowly dwindling, and I sometimes fell victim of comparing our small/humble facility to some of our peers who had much nicer buildings, a full census, and impressive staff rosters with even more impressive resumes. \n",
      "Despite the obvious challenges of opening a self-funded business in a competitive field with very little startup capital we truly believed, at our core, we had the ability to impact change wit an irrational confidence that if we do the right thing for the right reasons it’ll work out. \n",
      "Slow & Steady. Mission Statement always comes first. Give a sh*t about every single person who walks through the door. Believe that Quality of Care wins in the long run. However, when your daily stressors include finding the cheapest printer ink refills because the money is almost gone - it’s easier said than done. \n",
      "By late 2017, we moved to a larger building, driven by the belief that if we built it, they would come—and they did. Shortly thereafter we took another chance and started treating Mental Health primary individuals in addition to Substance Abuse. This may seem like an obvious pivot today, but in 2018 there were hardly (if any) other viable options in the Scottsdale area doing this. Yet, we were determined to do what we believed in - despite often being met with skepticism and uncertainty. \n",
      "Today SPRC has treated thousands of clients to great success, multiple in-depth tracts running concurrently that treat a variety of disorders, expanded to add Residential treatment to our continuum, and have grown to a team of 40+ professionals. \n",
      "When we started off I used to tell myself, “If we can make it 5 years we’re a real business and I have succeeded.” As we enter our 9th year, my perspective is completely different and would take a short novel for me to fully explain all of the ways this experience is changed me and my life on every conceivable level. \n",
      "I'm beyond grateful to every staff member, client, and professional who's been part of SPRC's journey, and I eagerly anticipate the next 8 years.\n",

      " Congratulations to Rhafia Bucoy, DBA, MSN, RN, RN-BC, Regional Clinical Practice Consultant, Perioperative Services, NCAL Kaiser Permanente, recipient of The DAISY Foundation DAISY Nurse Leader Award.\n",
      "Rhafia Bucoy is NCAL Perioperative Services’ clinical practice and financial performance consultant. She serves as an OR nurse informaticist and analyst, and she is definitely everyone’s “go-to person” for everything Perioperative data, clinical staffing, OpTime build, and all other things. Rhafia is the nurse in the background who silently gets things done, from report build to data mining, analysis, and presentations. She is the clinical liaison to the national teams for KPHC, national product council, and revenue cycle. She is responsible for the clinical testing and auditing of electronic med record documentation.\n",
      "Despite the overwhelming demand for reports and other competing priorities, Rhafia manages them well and always willingly helps others. She has collaborated with revenue cycle in closing out unposted surgical logs and ensuring accurate implant documentation. She has also recently agreed to close out records related to bedside procedure recovery to ensure accurate capture of workload and patient throughout in the post operative space.\n",
      "Rhafia serves as the clinical lead and resource for all of NCAL’s surgical system administrators as she lends her expert consulting hat in the OpTime domain from case creation to case closure and posting. Rhafia partnered with supply chain on the implementation of Case Pick App in 19 NCAL facilities, 11 of which went live in 2023. This application helps accurate accounting of supplies used in each surgical case leading to cost valuation and eventual supply standardization. With a few\n",
      "more sites going live in 2024, procedure card maintenance is key and Rhafia recognized this gap in some locations. With this information, she took the initiative to reinvigorate and develop training modules on procedure card updates. She partnered with the national training team and launched the first facilitator-led training in January of 2024.\n",
      "Another important work that Rhafia is leading is the implementation of the Preop and PACU bay assignment to capture both medical and surgical workload in the perioperative spaces to inform staffing decisions. Her collaboration with the workforce and finance teams is critical in this important work.\n",
      "Rhafia is a self-directed and a silent nurse leader in the Perioperative space. Her contributions to KP NCAL nursing can easily go unnoticed but definitely worthy of a recognition. She is an asset to have in the team.\n",

      "RheoMed MSO is proud to be one of greater than 100 health care entities participating in the California Data Exchange Framework through LANES in Los Angeles County. We join medical groups, hospitals, clinics, health plans, MSO’s, health departments, mental health facilities, post-acute facilities, and social service organizations that want to coordinate and improve care by exchanging data for patient care in real time. \n",
      "However, not all health care entities participate in data exchange. Sometimes this is due to relatively challenging situations such as cost, personnel, expertise, priorities, etc. The state of CA has provided financial and technical support to help overcome some of these barriers.\n",
      "In other cases, companies, while publicly supportive of data exchange, choose not to participate due to reasons such as competitive advantage, “proprietary information”, or simply control. This behavior is inexcusable, if not scandalous, because it interferes with optimal patient care.\n",

      "Phoenix Children’s, a leading pediatric healthcare system in Maricopa County, Arizona, faced increasing demand due to the region's rapid population growth. The hospital needed an effective patient acquisition strategy beyond traditional Google searches to maintain its leadership and support expansion. Phoenix Children’s partnered with Healthgrades to enhance its online presence and reach a broader audience of commercially-insured consumers.\n",

      "1. Expand digital marketing initiatives.\n",
      "2. Increase patient volumes, particularly among new residents seeking pediatric care.\n",
      "3. Promote general practitioners and specialists in a region with diverse healthcare needs.\n",
      "4. Engage caregivers (parents, grandparents, guardians) making healthcare decisions for children.\n",
      "Solution:\n",
      "1. Phoenix Children’s collaborated with Healthgrades to highlight nearly 200 doctors accepting new patients.\n",
      "2. Healthgrades’ platform prominently featured Phoenix Children’s physicians, even on competitor profiles.\n",
      "3. The strategy targeted primary care, orthopedic, and cardiovascular pediatric care.\n",

      " When seeking care with a Kaiser Permanente Physician, members can rest assured that 'Prior Authorization' for necessary services is not a concern. At KP, our physicians rely on decades of evidence-based medical practices and utilize the World's most sophisticated EMR, eliminating the need for prior auth and pre-cert requests.

      " Navigating network adequacy standards is a challenge for many managed care plans in California. The 2024 Network Certification Requirements for County MHPs and DMC-ODS Plans by California Department of Health Care Services confirmed a pivotal solution: the use of synchronous telehealth services can be used to meet network adequacy standards. Telehealth not only ensures compliance with network adequacy but also provides timely and appropriate access to mental health and substance use disorder services for patients willing to utilize telehealth, where it is medically appropriate for virtual care.\n",
      "At TeleMed2U, we are committed to leveraging telehealth to meet these standards, ensuring patients have timely access to mental health services.
